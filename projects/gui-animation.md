## Overview

In this project, you will create a program with a Graphical User
Interface (GUI) and animation built using JavaFX and Scene Builder.

## Materials

-   IntelliJ, JavaFX and SceneBuilder
-   **This project must be completed independently, without a partner**
-   [Java 19 API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/index.html)
-   [JavaFX Layout Tutorial](https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/javafx-layouts-basic/)
<!-- -   [Sample Pig Game Project](../code/151-pig.zip) -->

## Description

Write a Java Application. Your program can be anything you like, subject
to the following requirements

-   You must incorporate a GUI built with JavaFX and SceneBuilder.
-   At least two of the GUI components should have event handlers that
    produce visible changes in the GUI.
-   The program should include an interactive animation that makes use of the
    various Shape classes.    
-   The GUI should have some persistent state that is modeled by a class
    of your own creation. The class should represent an abstraction of
    the underlying data representation. The `Controller` will have an 
    instance of this class as one of its attributes.
-   The program should do something useful or interesting. It need not
    be complex, but it should be something that someone would
    conceivably want to use.

Feel free to use the [Java 19 API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/index.html) as a reference for any
piece of Java you might need.

## What to Hand In

Submit a zip file containing your whole project via Teams, and an
evaluation document detailing the intent of your application, any unique
and interesting features in your application, and any joys or struggles
you encountered in creating your application.
