## Description

In this project, you will create a program of your own design,
incorporating elements of data structures in your implementation.

## Materials

-   IntelliJ, JavaFX and SceneBuilder
-   [Java 13
    API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/index.html)

## Description

Write a complex Java Application. Your program can be anything you like,
subject to the following requirements

-   You must incorporate a GUI built with JavaFX and SceneBuilder.
-   The GUI should have some persistent state that is modeled by classes
    of your own creation.
-   The classes should represent an abstraction of the underlying data
    representation.
-   Your model must incorporate numerous classes and enums in a sensible
    organization. Use the Maze or TicTacToe labs as a goal to strive for
    in your project.
-   You must incorporate at least one of the data structures discussed
    in this course beyond a List (Stack, Queue, Binary Search Tree,
    Trie, HashTable, Heap).

Feel free to use the [Java 13
API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/index.html) as a
reference for any piece of Java you might need.

## What to Hand In

Submit a zip file containing your whole project on Moodle, and an
evaluation document detailing the intent of your application, any unique
and interesting features in your application, and any joys or struggles
you encountered in creating your application.

You will be presenting your final project to the rest of the students in
the course. You will have at most **15 minutes** for your presentation,
which must include a demonstration of your project. The final exam
period for this course is {{page.finaldue}}.
