Upon completing this course, our goal is for you to be able to:

1. Build substantial computer programs with graphical user interfaces to effectively solve realistic problems.
2. Understand and implement fundamental data structures to manage complexity.
3. Explain the compromises necessary to develop efficient programs.
4. Use and justify appropriate programming algorithms for specific tasks.
5. Decouple problem specification from program implementation through abstraction.
6. Employ test-driven and empirical methods to understand the behavior of a program.
7. Discuss the ways programming languages employ distinct features to solve problems.
8. Develop an aptitude and skills for independent learning.

# Coursework

Each student has **four late days** to spend throughout the semester as they wish.
Simply inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment
that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24
hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no
partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will
both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal
circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and
exceptional circumstances (you get sick, travel for a game or family
obligation, *etc.*). After you have used up your late days, late assignments
will receive at most half credit. All work must be completed the day before final grades are due.
**You must be in communication with me when assignments are late.**

## <a name="labs">Labs</a>: 240 points

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through weekly labs. Each lab will be assigned in lab with time allotted to work through the materials, and will be due **by the start of the following lab**. All labs are weighted equally within the lab portion of your final grade.

On these labs, you will work with a partner on the lab assignments. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work. A partnership should only turn in a **single copy** of the assignment. If students working as partners wish to turn in a lab late, all students must use a late day.

**Lab attendance is required**. Labs take place on Microsoft Teams. I will be
stationed in the Snoddy Computer Lab in the library for our lab times. If you
need to use computing resources on campus for these labs, please contact me
so we can find accomodations.

## <a name="hw">Homework</a>: 100 points

| #  | Name | Points |
|:--:|-----||:--------:|
|0 | [Survey](https://forms.gle/3f36yr8WHxBShjHN7) |
|1 | [Eating Candy]({{site.baseurl}}/homework/candy.html) | 10 |

|3 | [Making Toast]({{site.baseurl}}/homework/toaster.html) | 10 |

There will often be short homework assignments to be completed over the weekend, assigned on Friday and due the next week. These will be practice to
help you solidify the concepts from class before labs and exams.

## <a name="projects">Projects</a>: 400 points

| #  | Name | Points |
|:--:|-----||:------:|
|1 | [Java and Arrays]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/arrays.html)  | 50  |
|2 | [GUI and Animation]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/gui-animation.html) | 100 |
|3 | [Final Project]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/final-project.html) | 250 |

You will have three projects in this course, one about every five weeks. These projects will cover concepts we have discussed in class and in labs, and will be due approximately two weeks after they are assigned.

**You must work individually on the first two projects.** You may discuss concepts and ideas with your classmates, but the code you turn in must be your own. You will be graded not only on correctness, but also technique, documentation and evaluation of your solution. Further details on the grading standards and handin instructions for each project will be given when they are assigned.

## <a name="exams">Exams</a>: 200 points

There will be two exams, both worth 100 points of your final grade.
They will consist of short answer questions along with writing and debugging code.

* Exam 1: covering basic Java commands, classes, objects, enums, 2D arrays, stacks, and queues
* Exam 2: covering heaps, sorting algorithms, algorithmic analysis, lists, trees, and hash tables

There is no final exam; you will complete a final project instead, as described above under Projects.

If you earn less than 80 points on an exam, you may earn back up to an 80 by scheduling meetings with me to revisit missed questions and demonstrate your understanding on new and similar questions.

## <a name="checkins">Checkins</a>: 60 points

Four times throughout the semester, you are expected to
make an office hours appointment and check in with me about the course. Each checkin
meeting will count for 15 points.
This will be conversation and feedback about your current progress and understanding.
Ideally, these should be scheduled during the weeks shown
on the [course calendar](https://prod.teamgantt.com/gantt/schedule/?ids=2650881&public_keys=zduoIG6gLuL1&zoom=d100&font_size=12&estimated_hours=0&assigned_resources=0&percent_complete=0&documents=0&comments=0&col_width=355&hide_header_tabs=0&menu_view=1&resource_filter=1&name_in_bar=0&name_next_to_bar=0&resource_names=1&resource_hours=1#user=&company=&custom=&date_filter=&hide_completed=false&color_filter=).
