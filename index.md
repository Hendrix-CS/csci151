## <a name="goals">Learning Goals</a>

Upon completing this course, our goal is for you to be able to:

1. Build substantial computer programs with graphical user interfaces to effectively solve realistic problems.
2. Understand and implement fundamental data structures to manage complexity.
3. Explain the compromises necessary to develop efficient programs.
4. Use and justify appropriate programming algorithms for specific tasks.
5. Decouple problem specification from program implementation through abstraction.
6. Employ test-driven and empirical methods to understand the behavior of a program.
7. Discuss the ways programming languages employ distinct features to solve problems.
8. Develop an aptitude and skills for independent learning.

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through weekly labs. Each lab will be assigned in lab with time allotted to work through the materials, and will be due **by the start of the following lab**. 

On these labs, you will work with a partner on the lab assignments. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work. A partnership should only turn in a **single copy** of the assignment. If students working as partners wish to turn in a lab late, all students must use a late day.

{% include important.html content="Lab attendance is required. We will be
stationed in the Snoddy Computer Lab in the library for our lab times." %}

There will often be short homework assignments to be completed individually, due in one week. These will be practice to
help you solidify the concepts from class before labs and projects.

{% include warning.html content="You must work individually on the homeworks. You may discuss concepts and ideas with your classmates, but the code or work you turn in must be your own." %}

|3 | [Animation]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/animation.html) |

You will have three skills projects in this course, one about every four weeks. These projects will cover concepts we have discussed in class and in labs, and will be due approximately two weeks after they are assigned.

You will be graded not only on correctness, but also technique, documentation and evaluation of your solution. Further details on the grading standards and handin instructions for each project will be given when they are assigned.

## <a name="checkins">Checkins</a>

Four times throughout the semester, you are expected to
make an office hours appointment and check in with me about the course. 
This will be conversation and feedback about your current progress and understanding.
Ideally, these should be scheduled during the weeks shown
on the [course calendar](https://app.teamgantt.com/public/projects/calendar/2022-08-23?&ids=3161216&projectIds=3161216&publicKeys=nxIJq9avVtbh&prefs=P2lkcz0zMTYxMjE2JnB1YmxpY19rZXlzPW54SUpxOWF2VnRiaCZ6b29tPWQxMDAmZm9udF9zaXplPTEyJmVzdGltYXRlZF9ob3Vycz0wJmFzc2lnbmVkX3Jlc291cmNlcz0wJnBlcmNlbnRfY29tcGxldGU9MCZkb2N1bWVudHM9MCZjb21tZW50cz0wJmNvbF93aWR0aD0zNTUmaGlkZV9oZWFkZXJfdGFicz0wJm1lbnVfdmlldz0xJnJlc291cmNlX2ZpbHRlcj0xJm5hbWVfaW5fYmFyPTAmbmFtZV9uZXh0X3RvX2Jhcj0wJnJlc291cmNlX25hbWVzPTEmcmVzb3VyY2VfaG91cnM9MQ%3D%3D).

## <a name="scale">Specifications Grading</a>

Each assignment is assessed as **Complete**, **Partially Complete** or **Missing**. Criteria for the first two categories will be specified for each assignment. Final course grades are earned based on cumulative assignment outcomes:

### A Level Work

* Complete 11 of 12 Labs
* Complete 9 of 10 Homeworks
* Complete all 4 Office Hours checkins
* Complete all 3 Skills projects
* Complete the Final project

### B Level Work

* Complete 10 of 12 Labs + 1 Partially Complete
* Complete 8 of 10 Homeworks
* Complete 3 Office Hours checkins
* Complete all 3 Skills projects
* Partially Complete the Final project

### C Level Work

* Complete 8 of 12 Labs + 2 Partially Complete
* Complete 6 of 10 Homeworks
* Complete 2 Office Hours checkins
* Complete 2 of 3 Skills projects + 1 Partially Complete

### D Level Work

* Complete 6 of 12 Labs + 3 Partially Complete
* Complete 5 of 10 Homeworks
* Complete 1 Office Hours checkin
* Complete 1 of 3 Skills projects + 2 Partially Complete

Assignments have due dates to help you make progress in the course and solidify your knowledge before moving on to something new. Your life and schedule may not perfectly coincide with the due dates I have chosen. Therefore, each student starts the course with **four late days** to spend throughout the semester as they wish. Simply inform me any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment that you wish to use a late day and the reason you need an extension; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24 hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will both use 1 late day. 

After you have used up your four late days, **you must schedule a meeting with me to earn more late days**, otherwise late assignments will not be accepted. 

{% include note.html content="Late days are intended to cover both normal circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and exceptional circumstances (you get sick, travel for a game or family obligation, *etc.*)." %}

{% include important.html content="You must be in communication with me anytime an assignment is late." %}

If you would like to improve an assignment after it has been graded and improve your grade, you may revise and resubmit the assignment until you do. There is no deadline for resubmitted assignments.

However, the above only applies if you **made a reasonable attempt at the assignment the first time**. You cannot turn in a half-finished assignment before the deadline and then “revise” it by completing the rest. If your assignment is only half-finished, you must request use late days as described above.

{% include important.html content="All work and revisions must be completed the day of the final exam period for this course at 5pm." %}
