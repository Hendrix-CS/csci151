## <a name="goals">Learning Goals</a>

Upon completing this course, our goal is for you to be able to:

1. Build substantial computer programs with graphical user interfaces to effectively solve realistic problems.
2. Understand and implement fundamental data structures to manage complexity.
3. Explain the compromises necessary to develop efficient programs.
4. Use and justify appropriate programming algorithms for specific tasks.
5. Decouple problem specification from program implementation through abstraction.
6. Employ test-driven and empirical methods to understand the behavior of a program.
7. Discuss the ways programming languages employ distinct features to solve problems.
8. Develop an aptitude and skills for independent learning.

# Coursework

[*Adapted from Spencer Bagley and David Clark, via [Robert
Talbert](https://rtalbert.org/a-real-world-approach-to-deadlines/)*]

CSCI 151 uses a **real-world policy** on due dates---but this may not
mean what you think!  In the *real* real world, due dates exist but
they are often not ironclad.  Assignments have due dates to help you 
make progress in the course and solidify your knowledge before moving on 
to something new. Your life and schedule may not perfectly coincide 
with the due dates I have chosen. If you need more time to
get the job done well, you email whoever set the deadline to ask if
you can have more time.  Studies have shown that deadline extension
requests---in moderation and when truly needed---often lead to
*better* employee evaluations (not to mention better work). [*See [Go
Ahead and Ask for More Time on that
Deadline](https://hbr.org/2021/12/go-ahead-and-ask-for-more-time-on-that-deadline)
by Ashley Williams*.]

**If you need an extension on a due date, email me and explain what
you need**, and it will probably be fine.  It helps if you propose a
concrete new deadline (*e.g.* "I can get it done by 5pm on
Wednesday").  If you ask for lots of extensions, we'll work together
to find a way to help you keep up.  Note, however, that late
submissions may not receive feedback as quickly as on-time
submissions.

If you have significant extenuating circumstances that cause you to
miss multiple deadlines, please [come to office
hours](markgoadrich.youcanbook.me) to discuss broader accommodations.  I'm
happy to be flexible, but it helps to know what you need so I can
figure out the best way to help.

{% include important.html content="You must be in communication with me anytime an assignment is late." %}

If you would like to improve an assignment after it has been graded and improve your grade, you may revise and resubmit the assignment until you do. This must be **within two weeks of receiving feedback**. If you need more than two weeks, *you must schedule a meeting with me to discuss your reasons for the delay*.

{% include important.html content="All work and revisions must be completed the day of the final exam period for this course at 5pm." %}

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through weekly labs. Each lab will be assigned in lab with time allotted to work through the materials, and will be due **by the start of the following lab**. 

On these labs, you will work with a partner on the lab assignments. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work. A partnership should only turn in a **single copy** of the assignment. If students working as partners wish to turn in a lab late, all students must use a late day.

{% include important.html content="Lab attendance is required. We will be
stationed in the Snoddy Computer Lab in the library for our lab times." %}

There will often be short homework assignments to be completed individually, due in one week. These will be practice to
help you solidify the concepts from class before labs and projects.

{% include warning.html content="You must work individually on the homeworks. You may discuss concepts and ideas with your classmates, but the **code or work you turn in must be your own**. Use of any resources (TA, Stackoverflow, ChatGPT, etc) must be cited, and an overreliance on those resources can be counterproductive to developing your own ability to make progress in this and other courses." %}

|3 | [Animation]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/animation.html) |

You will have three skills projects in this course, one about every four weeks. These projects will cover concepts we have discussed in class and in labs, and will be due approximately two weeks after they are assigned.

You will be graded not only on correctness, but also technique, documentation and evaluation of your solution. Further details on the grading standards and handin instructions for each project will be given when they are assigned.

## <a name="checkins">Checkins</a>

Three times throughout the semester, you are expected to
make an office hours appointment and discuss your progress in the course. This will include conversation and feedback about your current progress and understanding.
Ideally, these checkins should be scheduled during the weeks shown
on the [course calendar](https://prod.teamgantt.com/gantt/schedule/?ids=3800427&public_keys=9EXxMLt23f63&zoom=d100&font_size=12&estimated_hours=0&assigned_resources=0&percent_complete=0&documents=0&comments=0&col_width=355&hide_header_tabs=0&menu_view=1&resource_filter=1&name_in_bar=0&name_next_to_bar=0&resource_names=1&resource_hours=1#user=&company=&custom=&date_filter=&hide_completed=&color_filter=).

## <a name="attendance">Attendance</a>

Attending class and being an active participant in the class community
is one of the [most important contributors to your learning at Hendrix](https://www.hendrix.edu/Catalog/2023-2024/Academic_Policies_and_Regulations/Policies_and_Appeals/D_6_e__Class_Attendance/).
Attendance is especially important in this class since you will often engage in group learning activities. Active participation is expected in order to achieve higher grade levels in the course. 

If you know that you will be absent, please email me so that we can find accomodations. If there is an emergency, please get in touch with me as soon as is possible once the emergency is resolved. I trust you to be honest with me about your reasons for the absence (I do not need details), and honest with yourself about if you truly need to be absent. **If you do not communicate with me about your absence, it will be unexcused.**

## <a name="scale">Specifications Grading</a>
