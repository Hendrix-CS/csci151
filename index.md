## <a name="goals">Learning Goals</a>

Upon completing this course, our goal is for you to be able to:

1. Build substantial computer programs with graphical user interfaces to effectively solve realistic problems.
2. Understand and implement fundamental data structures to manage complexity.
3. Explain the compromises necessary to develop efficient programs.
4. Use and justify appropriate programming algorithms for specific tasks.
5. Decouple problem specification from program implementation through abstraction.
6. Employ test-driven and empirical methods to understand the behavior of a program.
7. Discuss the ways programming languages employ distinct features to solve problems.
8. Develop an aptitude and skills for independent learning.

## Laptop Policy

Please **do not bring laptops to lecture**. This may seem strange in a computer science class. But lab is the place where you will get plenty of experience working on the computer; lecture is a time for thinking and learning without the distraction of a computer.

Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis if you can prove to me that you really do benefit from using your laptop to take notes.

# Coursework

Each student has **four late days** to spend throughout the semester as they wish.
Simply inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment
that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24
hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no
partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will
both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal
circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and
exceptional circumstances (you get sick, travel for a game or family
obligation, *etc.*). After you have used up your late days, late assignments
will receive at most half credit.

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through weekly labs. Each lab will be assigned in lab with time allotted to work through the materials, and will be due **by the start of the following lab**. All labs are weighted equally within the lab portion of your final grade.

On these labs, you will work with a partner on the lab assignments. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work. A partnership should only turn in a **single copy** of the assignment. If students working as partners wish to turn in a lab late, both students must use a late day.

**Lab attendance is required**. Labs take place in the **Snoddy Computer Lab**, in the Bailey Library. As you go through the exterior door of the library, turn immediately to your left and enter the Snoddy Academic Resource Center. Continue through the door at the far end of the hall into the first computer lab, and then enter the second lab at the back.

## <a name="projects">Projects</a>: 470 points

| #  | Name | Points | Assigned | Due |
|:--:|-----||:------:|:--------:|:---:|
|1 | [Java and Arrays]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/arrays.html)  | 50  | Jan 31 | Feb 14 |
|2 | [GUI and Animation]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/gui-animation.html) | 100 | Feb 26 | Mar 9 |

|4 | [Final Project]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/final-project.html) | 200 | Apr 17 | May 12 |

You will have four projects in this course, one about every four weeks. These projects will cover concepts we have discussed in class and in labs, and will be due approximately two weeks after they are assigned.

**You must work individually on the first three projects.** You may discuss concepts and ideas with your classmates, but the code you turn in must be your own. You will be graded not only on correctness, but also technique, documentation and evaluation of your solution. Further details on the grading standards and handin instructions for each project will be given when they are assigned.

## <a name="exams">Exams</a>: 200 points

There will be two in-class exams, both worth 100 points of your final grade.
They will consist of short answer questions along with writing and debugging code.

* Exam 1: Feb 24, covering basic Java commands, classes, objects, enums, 2D arrays, stacks, and queues
* Exam 2: May 1, covering heaps, sorting algorithms, algorithmic analysis, lists, trees, and hash tables

There is no final exam; you will complete a final project instead, as described above under Projects.

## <a name="checkins">Checkins and Participation</a>: 90+ points

Three times throughout the semester, you are expected to
make an office hours appointment and check in with me about the course. Each checkin
meeting will count for 15 points.
This will be conversation and feedback about your current progress and understanding.
These should be scheduled during the weeks shown
on the [course calendar](https://app.teamgantt.com/public/projects/calendar/2020-01-05?ids=1972972&projectIds=1972972&publicKeys=bWZU5DuRsTN4&userResourceIds=0).

Also, there will be many opportunities to accumulate small amounts of points
throughout the semester by participating in classroom exercises and
reflecting on the material. These will total at least 45 points, most likely more.
