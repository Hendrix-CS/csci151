Write a project using JavaFX to make a program that records how many times a button has been clicked.

Your project should include at a minimum a BorderPane with a Button and a Label, created through SceneBuilder. 

The controller should link up these through fields, and include an additional integer field to track the number of times the button has been pressed.

You should also attach a method to the Button which increments the counter field, and then writes this number to the label on the screen.

Use the Lab 6 code as a template for creating this project.

Turn in a zip of your project through Teams by the due date.
