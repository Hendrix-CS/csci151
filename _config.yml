# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  This course builds on skills acquired in CSCI 150, placing emphasis on object-oriented
  software design and data abstraction. Students are introduced to data
  structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash tables, graphs) and
  programming techniques such as recursion and sorting algorithms. Other topics
  include analysis of algorithm complexity, automated unit testing, inheritance.
  Programming assignments focus on the design and implementation of algorithms
  and data structures using the Java language.
