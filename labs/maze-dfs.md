## Overview

In this lab, we will implement a generic version of the Stack
data type within the context of creating a maze.

## Materials

-   IntelliJ
-   Lab partner

## Setup


1.  Download the [skeleton](../code/maze151dfs.zip) for this project.
2.  Extract the code, then open the maze151dfs folder in IntelliJ to start a new project.

## Description

In this lab, we will explore creating a maze using a stack to
organize our potential Positions. The stack allows us to create in a
depth-first search manner. In other words, we can carve out a trail
as far as possible, and backtrack if we reached a dead end in our
journey, because we search the youngest potential position next.

In this lab, you will create the necessary data structures to create a
maze in this depth-first search manner.

To start, run the code in `MazeApp`. You
should see the GUI layout here.

![](../assets/images/mazegui5.png){: .img-fluid}

There are a few new pieces to this GUI. First, you will see a
choice for either `ArrayStack` or `ListStack`.
You will find the starter code for these included in the
`maze.searchers` directory.

Second, you will notice that there are statistics in the middle portion
of the GUI, recording the number of `OPEN`, `CLOSED`, and `VISITED` squares.

Third, there is a box at the bottom, to report errors when
things go wrong with the underlying implementations. It will also report
the number of steps taken when a solution trail is found through
searching.

{% include note.html content="This project contains a working implementation of the Maze
Enum and Array Lab, so you do not have to revise any of your earlier code to add
this functionality." %}

## Step 1 - ArrayStack\<E\>

Our first task is to implement a generic Stack class that can be used in many
pieces of the code, for generating and then solving mazes.

Write a class called `ArrayStack<E>`. This will need to implement the
`Stack<E>` interface. The fields and constructor are provided for you.

{% include important.html content="All of your
implementations for this lab will be located in the `maze.searchers`
directory." %}

### Step 1.1 - `public void push(E item)`

If there is no more room in the `stuff` array, you will need to **resize**.

* Create a new array twice as big as `stuff`.
* Copy over each item into the new array.
* Redirect the `stuff` reference to the new array.

Now, you can always add the new item to `top` spot in the `stuff` array,
and increment the `top`.

### Step 1.2 - `public E pop()`

Call the `emptyCheck` method. This will throw an `IllegalStateException`
if the stack is empty.

Decrement the value of `top`, and then return the item in the `top` spot
of the `stuff` array.

### Step 1.3 - `public E peek()`

Call the `emptyCheck` method. This will throw an `IllegalStateException`
if the stack is empty.

Return the item in the `top - 1` spot of the `stuff` array.

### Step 1.4 - `public int size()`

Return the number of items in `stuff`.

### Step 1.5 - `public String toString()`

Return a `String` representing the elements in the stack separated
by spaces. For example, a stack of integers with 3 on top of 2 on top of 1
should return "1 2 3". The oldest element in the stack should be the first
in the string.

### Step 1.6 - Testing

Run the `ArrayStackTest` suite, and ensure your above methods are passing
these tests.

## Step 2 - ListStack\<E\>

Next we will implement the generic version of a Stack with nodes, called 
`ListStack<E>`. This will need to implement the `Stack<E>` interface, and have 
at least a `ListNode<E>` called `top` as a field., 

### Step 2.1 - ListNode

Look over the file called `ListNode.java`. This class
implements the Node class we discussed. It should have an `E value` and
a `ListNode next` reference as private components, along with public get and set
methods for the value and next fields. There are two constructors.
The first brings in and stores only an `E value`, and leaves the `ListNode next` as `null`.
The second brings in both an `E value`, and a `ListNode next`, storing both.

{% include note.html content="While the name of the file is `ListNode.java`, the name of the class when used
will be `ListNode<E>`." %}

### Step 2.2 - `public void push(E data)`

Study the code provided. It will create a new `ListNode` that stores the `data`, 
has the current `top`as its `next`, and finally redirects `top` to 
reference this new `ListNode`.

### Step 2.3 - `public E pop()`

Call the `emptyCheck` method. This will throw an `IllegalStateException`
if the stack is empty.

Save the value stored in `top`, and redirect `top` to point to the `next` `ListNode`.

Return the value you stored.

### Step 2.4 - `public E peek()`

Call the `emptyCheck` method. This will throw an `IllegalStateException`
if the stack is empty.

Return the value stored in the `top` `ListNode`.

### Step 2.5 - `public int size()`

If `top` is `null`, return 0. Otherwise,
return the number of `ListNode` that are chained from the `top` node.

### Step 2.6 - `public String toString()`

Return a `String` representing the elements in the stack separated
by spaces. For example, a stack of integers with 3 on top of 2 on top of 1
should return "1 2 3". The oldest element in the stack should be the first
in the string.

### Step 2.7 - Testing

Run the `ListStackTest` suite, and ensure your above methods are passing
these tests.

### Step 3 - Creating Random Mazes

Uncomment code labeled for this portion in

-   MazeController

We will explore two different algorithms for creating random mazes, by implementing the
`tunnelRandomly` function in the `Puzzle` class, defined as

`public void tunnelRandomly(boolean perfect)`

### Step 3.1 - Perfect Mazes

A perfect maze is [one without any loops or closed circuts](https://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm). We can achieve this with the following algorithm by preventing the opening of nodes with more than one neighbor, using the `numOpenNeighbors(Position p)` method in the `Maze`.

Create an `ArrayStack` of `Positions`, and push `new Position(0,0)` onto the stack.

While the stack still has Positions:

-   Pop the top `Position` from the stack.
-   If this `Position` is in the maze, is filled, and has no more than one open neighbor,
    -   Clear this `Position`
    -   Add the neighbors to the stack in a **random** order.

{% include tip.html content="You should
    use the `randomDirections` method of
    `Direction` in the code above." %}

### Step 3.2 - Braided Mazes

A braided maze is one without any dead ends. With a slightly different algorithm for opening cells, we can create these mazes. Use the `boolean perfect` parameter to allow for both algorithms to be run
in this one `tunnelRandomly` method.

Create an `ArrayStack` of `Positions`, and push `new Position(0,0)` onto the stack.

While the stack still has Positions:

-   Pop the top `Position` from the stack.
-   Try to `clear` this `Position`.
-   If the clear was successful (returned `true`):
    -   Add the `CLOSED` neighbors of this `Position` to the stack in a **random** order.

### Step 3.3 - GUI

Run the GUI to interact with your code and make random mazes. You should
see mazes similar to the image below when making **Perfect** mazes.
