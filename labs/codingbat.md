## Overview

This week, you will use the website CodingBat to learn Java syntax and
structure.

## Materials

*   [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/java)
*   Lab partners

As you work with
partners today, be sure that you:

*   Create a single, shared account (Step 1 below)
*   Put all your names on the shared account in the Memo section
*   **Rotate who has the keyboard with each new problem.**

## Description
### Step 1

Go to [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/java) and click on "create
account" in the top right. Use one of your Hendrix emails as your account id,
and choose a password.

### Step 2

Once you are logged in, click on "prefs" in the top right. In the box at the
bottom labelled "Share To", fill in the Hendrix email address of your
lab instructor (`goadrich@hendrix.edu`), then click "Share". This will
allow your instructor to see your progress.

Fill all of your names in the Memo section.

### Step 3

Click on [Warmup-1](http://codingbat.com/java/Warmup-1) in the Java
section of CodingBat. Click on
[sleep\_in](http://codingbat.com/prob/p187868). Read the description of
the desired function behavior, and fill in a suitable function
definition.

{% include note.html content="Unfortunately, CodingBat does not like it if you
use the Tab key. You will have to use spaces to indent your code." %}

Once you have filled in a definition for the function, click "Go". CodingBat
will automatically run your function on a number of test inputs and
check whether it has the required behavior. If your function passes all
the tests, you will get a big green check mark, and you can move on to
the next problem. Otherwise, the failing tests will be highlighted in
red; fix your function and try again.

### Step 4

Work with your partners to complete the problems described below in
the grading section.

## Academic Integrity

You must write the solutions with your partners and
work together. You may ask other students for advice, but remember
that

*   You **may not look at any other groups's code**.
*   You **may not show your code to any other students**.
*   You **may not look at or copy any solutions you find on the
    Internet**. This includes solutions on the CodingBat site itself.

{% include warning.html content="Evidence of any of the above will be treated as a potential violation of
the Hendrix Academic Integrity Policy." %}

## What to Hand In

You do not need to hand anything in. If you have shared your account
with your lab instructor as described in Step 2 above, your instructor
will be able to see your progress.
